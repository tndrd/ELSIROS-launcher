    class GoalKeeper is designed to define goalkeeper's play according to style developed by 
    Matvei Ivaschenko - a student of Phystech Lyceum in 2020.
    Idea of style was in dividing of home half of shoccer field to 8 sectors according to distance 
    from home goals. When ball is in 4 sectors closest to goals A1, A2, A3, A4 goalkeeper attacks ball with 
    purpose transfer it to side of opponent. When ball is in 4 sectors B1, B2, B3, B4 which are in longer
    distance from goals goalkeeper just slide to better position from current without attempt 
    to attack ball.
    In case if ball didn't go longer than 1m after kick of goalkeeper, he will undertake another attempt
    up to 10 times in total.
    In case if ball goes to distance longer than 1m or ball can't be seen by goalkeeper then goalkeeper

    class Player is designed for implementation of main cycle of player.
    Real robot have 3 programmable buttons. Combination of button pressing can transmit to programm pressed button
    code from 1 to 9. At initial button pressing role of player is selected. With second pressed button optional
    playing mode is selected depending on role. 
    For 'forward' and 'forward_old_style' role  second_pressed_button can take value 1 or value 4. With value 1
    player starts game as kick-off player,
    with value 4 player stars as non-kick-off player, which means player starts moving 10 seconds later.
    For 'run_test' role second_pressed_button can take values from 1 or value 9 with following optional modes:
    1 - 10 cycle steps walk forward
    2 - 20 cycle side step walk to right
    3 - 20 cycle side step walk to left
    4 - 20 cycle steps walk forward
    5 - 20 cycle steps with rotation to right side
    6 - 20 cycle steps with rotation to left side
    9 - 20 cycle steps of spot walk 
    All modes of run test are used with purpose to calibrate walking. After calibration is completed results of
    calibration must be input to file  Sim_params.json. Motion module is used calibration data for planning
    motions and odometry correction into localization.
